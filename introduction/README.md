# Introduction to web development
## Overview of web development and history
Web development refers to the process of building and maintaining websites. It involves a wide range of tasks, from creating simple static pages to developing complex web applications. The history of web development can be traced back to the early days of the internet when the first websites were created using basic HTML. Over time, advancements in technology have led to the development of more sophisticated tools and techniques for building websites.

## Client-side vs Server-side programming
In web development, code can be executed either on the client-side (i.e., on the user’s browser) or on the server-side (i.e., on a web server). Client-side programming involves writing code that is executed by the user’s browser and is used to create dynamic and interactive features on a webpage. Server-side programming, on the other hand, involves writing code that is executed on a web server and is used to generate dynamic content and handle tasks such as database interactions.

## Introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three core technologies used in web development. 

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure content on a webpage by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images. 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>HTML 5</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
	<script src="index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
_Example of HTML Structure_


CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style these elements by specifying their color, font size, layout etc. This is example of using CSS
``` css
p {
  color: red;
}
```

JavaScript is used to add interactivity to a webpage by allowing developers to create features such as drop-down menus or pop-up windows.

## Setting up a development environment
Setting up a development environment involves installing and configuring the tools needed for building websites. This includes text editors or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for writing code, in this case we are using Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
